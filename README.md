# Kibana Enhanced Table

This Kibana visualization plugin is like a Data Table, but with enhanced features like computed columns and filter bar.

## Features

- Add computed columns, based on other columns :
  - Support for [expr-eval](https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval#expression-syntax) expressions
  - Support for numeric columns (ex: `col0 + col1` or `col[0] + col[1]`)
  - Support for string columns, including HTML (ex: `col0 > 0 ? 'OK' : 'KO'`)
  - Support for date columns
  - Ability to reference total hits count returned by ES query (ex: `col0 / total * 100`)
  - Ability to reference a column by its label (ex: `col['Sum of duration'] / col['Count']`)
  - Support for numeric pretty format using [Numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com/#format) (ex: `0,0.00`)
  - Support for date pretty format using [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) (ex: `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - Support for column alignment (ex: `left`, `right`)
  - Support for template rendering using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/expressions.html) (ex: `<strong>{{value}}</strong>`)
  - Template can reference other columns (ex: `<span style="color: {{col0}}">{{value}}</span>`)
  - More documentation [here](#computed-column-formula--lines-computed-filter-documentation)
- Filter table lines based on a computed formula (ex: `col0 > 0`)
  - More documentation [here](#computed-column-formula--lines-computed-filter-documentation)
- Hide some table columns (ex: `0,1,Col2 Label` hides columns 0, 1 and the column labeled 'Col2 Label')
  - Note that the column label must be written as is (including whitespaces), with no surrounding quotes.
  - Column labels containing commas are not supported since the comma is used to separate the columns
  - It is recommended to use column labels to hide columns rather than their indices. Using the 'Split cols' feature, in fact, indices might depend on the global timerange that has been set. 
- Add a filter bar (ex: when user enters `cat` filter, it will display only rows that contain "cat")  
  - Works also with numeric and date columns
  - Ability to enable case sensitive filter
  - Ability to make filter bar hideable
  - Ability to filter as you type
  - Ability to filter each term separately
  - Ability to highlight filter results
  - Ability to define filter bar width
- Support for a new bucket type : 'Split Cols'. It lets to create a pivot table
  - When combined with computed columns, each computed column can be added per split column or after all split columns  
- Hide export links (when checked, it will hide "Raw" and "Formatted" export links)
- Add a total label on total line first column (ex: `Total:`)
- Kibana supported versions : all versions from 5.5 to 7.3
